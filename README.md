WooCommerce-Custom-Shipping-Plugins
===================================

This plugin adds a custom shipping method to WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping Called LVKC Custom Rate

This plugin charges 9.95 for up to 2 items of small, medium, large and extra large size. Each Jumbo size charges 9.95 for each item. 

So if there are 2 mediums and a Jumbo, shipping total is $19.90, not incliding price of item. If there is a small, medium, large and extra large the shipping total comes to 19.90 as well because we only charge 9.95 for every 2 items of small, medium, large, extra large. 

Installation
===================================

Under Products > Attributes, add a new attribute called Size. Add terms to the attribute called Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large, Jumbo.

Disable all shipping methods except for Custom Shipping Method
